# UVC Rust Engine

Rust-first Android UVC camera engine workspace. The current implementation is a compile-safe foundation for multi-camera concurrency validation, not a complete Android UVC driver.

## Current status

Completed against `plan.md` and `.kilo/plans/rust-uvc-engine.md`:

- Cargo workspace with `uvc-core`, `uvc-driver`, `uvc-jni`, and `uvc-cli`.
- Pure-Rust core types for camera identity, formats, frames, bounded frame channels, errors, and pipeline traits.
- Deterministic fake multi-camera backend that streams multiple synthetic cameras concurrently.
- CLI validation command for fake multi-camera runs.
- UVC descriptor parsing models with synthetic descriptor tests.
- Optional `rusb` feature plus backend, device, endpoint, interface, transfer, and device-profile abstractions.
- rusb-backed device discovery, active-config UVC interface parsing, device open, claim, alternate-setting activation, libusb async ISO multi-transfer ring, UVC packet assembly, MJPEG boundary detection, and assembled-frame sink integration.
- Android file-descriptor identity wrapper, Kotlin-facing JNI exports, and compile-safe `libusb_wrap_sys_device` boundary behind the `android` feature in `uvc-jni`.
- Workspace formatting, checks, and tests are passing.

Not complete yet:

- No hardware-validated UVC stream, decoded-frame pipeline, or Android rendering path.
- No Android target check, Kotlin companion classes, or `ANativeWindow`/`HardwareBuffer` path.
- No performance benchmark suite.
- No `LICENSE` file yet, despite the workspace package license metadata.

## Workspace layout

```text
crates/
  uvc-core/
    Pure Rust data model, error types, frame channel, and pipeline trait.
  uvc-driver/
    UVC descriptor parser, backend traits, rusb-backed device discovery/session management, libusb async ISO multi-transfer ring, UVC packet/MJPEG assembly, MJPEG frame sink adapter, fake deterministic camera backend, performance validation example, and concurrency validation harness.
  uvc-jni/
    Android USB file-descriptor identity wrapper, libusb fd wrapping boundary, opaque native engine handle, and JNI exports for initialize/start/stop/control/poll/release.
  uvc-cli/
    Local CLI tool for fake multi-camera validation.
```

## Commands

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo check --workspace --all-targets
cargo test --workspace
cargo run -p uvc-driver --example fake-multi-camera-perf -- --cameras 4 --seconds 1 --fps 30 --width 64 --height 64 --capacity-frames 128
cargo check -p uvc-driver --features rusb
```

## What next

Recommended order:

1. Validate the libusb async ISO multi-transfer ring on desktop Linux with UVC hardware and measure packet loss/recovery.
2. Add decoded MJPEG-to-RGBA/YUV sink integration for assembled frames.
3. Add Android target checks once the NDK and libusb build environment are configured.
4. Add Kotlin companion classes for the JNI exports.
6. Add benchmarks for frame buffer reuse, bounded-channel latency, and fake multi-camera throughput.
